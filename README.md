# ðŸŽ¸ Albums and Artists CRUD ðŸŽ¸


This is the front of a code challenge which is connected to a docker server.

It is a CRUD of albums and artists and then they're linked to each other in album detail, where you can click the artist and navigate to their detail.

## ðŸ¤˜Technologies:

- Angular 9.
- PrimeNG (implemented only in the notification bus)

## ðŸŽ§This is what I was asked to do:

- Required: run our API and communicate with it. 
- Required: develop an Angular 2+ app that uses our API and can list, show,
create, update and delete music albums. 
- Optional: provide the ability to list, show, create, update and delete artists and
allow us to link an album to an artist. If you donâ€™t have time to code this but you
still want to document a solution, that will be welcome. 
- Optional: use a CSS framework or design system if you find it useful.
- Optional: use the fields that we have for imageUrls to store photos. 
- Optional: provide a database dump to us so we can test it with a set of data that
you find useful. 

## ðŸŽ¶ To install and run the app:

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
