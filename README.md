Hi!

This is the front of a code challenge which is connected to a docker server.

You have to run npm install and then npm start to run the app.

The request by id of albums and artist are implemented but I'm not using them (except for the artist to connect it with the album) to avoid doing many requests to the server, so when I get all the data, its stored in the LocalStorage and then its filtered by id to get the detail.

The styles are made for desktop resolution only. There wasn'r time enough to make it responsive.


I didnt have enought time to style the notification message, I only could change the backgound color to make it visible. I hope you can see it!

I also didnt have enough time to re use components and styles from albums module in artists module, so I re did the module with its components with the same logic.

And this read me could be done in a better way, Im sorry!

I hope you like it!
